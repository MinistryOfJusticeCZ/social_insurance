# Connection to the Social insurence for Justice

Version of the connector - PoC written in Rails, using B2B services of Czech social insurance.
It contains basic prototype implementing newly developed design system.

The document generator prototype is needed to generate final PDF.

No more documentation is provided, as long as it is PoC.
Hopefully, the system is going to production soon and with it comming the documentation.

We are sorry for any inconvenience, but you can reach with us for further information.
